# ST3189 - Machine Learning

This repository contains my coursework for ST3189: Machine Learning module completed in academic year 2024-25. The project applied eboth supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to real-world public datasets and evaluated the models using appropriate performance metrics. 

Grade achieved: 73 / 100

## Datasets Used (All from Kaggle)
- Unsupervised Learning: Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset
- Regression: Medical Insurance Premium Dataset
- Classification: Student Performance Dataset

## Methods Applied
- Unsupervised Learning: Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering
- Regression: Linear Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest
- Classification: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks

All modelling was carried out in Python.
